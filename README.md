Project Description

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum to practice the fundamentals of HTML.
It consists of a main homepage (index.html) that links to multiple recipe pages, each containing a short description, ingredients list, and preparation steps.

The goal of this project was to understand how to structure a basic website using only HTML, focusing on clarity, organization, and proper linking between pages.
